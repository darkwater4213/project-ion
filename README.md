# Project ION  

A project manager for overworking students (the students themselves, not the overworking)

## Usage  

```
proj
  Launches the pullster TUI
proj --help
  Displays this help message
proj new
  Creates a new project under the current vault
proj [ vault | select ]
  Selects the current directory (or nearest parent) as vault or project
proj mark
  Earmarks your current progress
```

No, this isn't very well-designed.
